Dark100
======
The ERC consolidator project Dark100 will deploy an array of ~10 small Fresnel telescopes, designed by the PANOSETI group at University of San Diego, and use them for the detection of >10 TeV gamma rays via the imaging atmospheric Cherenkov technique. The ultimate goal of the project is to search for dark matter at higher masses than are probed by classical Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes.
